#### **1. Qualia – The Experience of Perception**
- **What it is**: Qualia refers to the individual, subjective experience of perception—how things *feel* to each of us. For example, the sensation of water on my skin, or the way I see the color blue, might be completely different from your experience of the same things.
- **Core Issue**: The philosophical question of *how can we ever know if our experiences of the same thing are identical?* We may share language and common references, but we can’t peer into each other’s minds to verify if we are experiencing the same subjective world.
- **The Struggle**: There’s an inevitable gap between my internal experience and yours. Even when we describe things in detail, there’s no way to fully bridge the subjective experience gap.
  
**Key Thought**: We function under the assumption that we experience things similarly, but there’s always that nagging doubt—*does your blue feel like my blue?* Or are we just playing in different keys while reading the same sheet of music?

#### **2. Thesis Understanding – Is My Perception of Your Argument the Same?**
- **What it is**: The philosophical tension of whether we *truly* understand another person’s ideas the way they intend. When I explain a concept, my understanding is filtered through *my experiences, knowledge, and biases*. You understand it through *yours*. 
- **Core Issue**: We can never know if we understand an argument or idea *in exactly the same way* as the person who expressed it. Even though we’re using the same language, our internal processing can lead to subtle variations in meaning.
- **The Struggle**: Even in deep philosophical discussions, there’s always a part of us that asks, *Did they really get what I meant?* Or did they just interpret it through their own lens, and now we’re operating on slightly different wavelengths?

**Key Thought**: Language narrows the gap between subjective understanding, but it never fully closes it. We talk, we agree, but our internal experiences remain unique to us.

#### **3. Are We Just Regurgitating What Is?**
- **What it is**: This touches on the idea of originality in thought. Are we ever truly *creating* new ideas, or are we just repeating what has always been there, rediscovered and rephrased by each generation? For example,the idea that *2+2=4* already exists—when we learn it, we’re not creating new knowledge, we’re just **affirming something pre-existing**.
- **Core Issue**: Plato’s notion of Forms fits in here. Everything we learn might just be a process of *remembering* or *recognizing* eternal truths that have always been. Are we genuinely original thinkers, or are we constantly reinterpreting ancient wisdom that already exists in some unchanging realm of knowledge?
- **The Struggle**: It feels like we’re growing and improving intellectually, but are we really? Or is it just the process of uncovering things that were always there? How much of what we call "learning" is just **repackaging old truths** in new contexts?

**Key Thought**: There may be no true originality. What we call innovation is really just a complex form of rediscovery, framed by our own moment in time.

#### **4. Plato’s Take on Wisdom and Originality**
- **What it is**: Plato’s concept of the **Theory of Forms** argues that all material objects are imperfect copies of ideal forms that exist in a higher realm. Similarly, *wisdom* is the process of **recognizing** these ideal forms, rather than creating something new.
- **Core Issue**: If everything we know is derived from eternal truths, what role does our personal insight play? When we think we’ve "discovered" something new, we may just be glimpsing the shadow of a higher truth already in existence. 
- **The Struggle**: Does this make all human thought derivative? And if so, should we embrace this as a humbling recognition that our contributions are part of a larger, unchanging truth?

**Key Thought**: True wisdom isn’t about creating something from nothing—it’s about reaching a deep understanding of **what already is**. Originality, in this context, is a paradox because everything we "know" is already out there.

### **Future Practices**:

1. **Mindful Reflection on Perception**:
   - **Daily Qualia Reflection**: Take a moment each day to focus on something simple—taste, color, sound—and reflect on how subjective your experience is. This will help you sharpen your awareness of the gap between your perception and others’.
   
2. **Dialogue with Others**:
   - **Ask Questions, Not Assumptions**: In conversations, practice asking others how they experience or understand certain ideas instead of assuming their experience is like yours. It will help deepen your communication and get a sense of that perception gap.

3. **Writing and Explaining Concepts**:
   - **Teach What You Learn**: When you learn a new concept, try explaining it to someone else or writing about it in your own words. The act of explaining forces you to understand the difference between **your internal understanding** and **how you present it**.

### **Random Thought Notes for the Future**:

1. **Is there any such thing as *truly* original thought, or is all thinking a process of uncovering and rephrasing eternal truths?**  
   - Consider: every new idea may be a reformulation of something timeless, which raises the question: What is the nature of innovation? Do we ever create something from nothing, or is discovery the true nature of thought?

2. **How does language shape the gap between experience and communication?**  
   - The more precise our language, the closer we get to bridging the subjective experience gap—but we can never fully close it. How does this play out in everyday life? Can we communicate with perfect clarity, or will we always have to live with the gap?

### **Closing Reflection**: 
This exploration into perception, wisdom, and originality has helped clarify something crucial: **understanding** is always personal, always filtered, and **never fully identical** to someone else’s. We live in a world where we share knowledge and ideas, but deep down, we’re always alone in our experience of those things. Yet, this makes each person’s journey uniquely their own—and that’s kind of beautiful.
