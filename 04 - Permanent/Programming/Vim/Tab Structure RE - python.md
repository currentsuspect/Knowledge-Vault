### 2. **Just Like the Tab Structure in Vim** (Re: Python's Indentation)

In Python, **indentation matters** for defining code blocks. You don’t use `{}` to mark where a function starts and ends like in other languages (e.g., C, Java). Instead, you use _spaces_ or _tabs_ to show which lines of code belong together.

For example:

```python
def example():
    print("This is inside the function.")
    print("This is also inside.")
print("This is outside the function.")
```
In Python:

- Everything indented at the same level belongs to the same block of code.
- If you change the indentation level (like switching from 4 spaces to 2), it’s treated as a new block.

Now, in **Vim**, when you’re writing code, you visually see indentation levels because of the way your code is structured. It’s like organizing your code into clean little "tabs" or "sections" to visually make sense of it. You can even customize **Vim** to use certain numbers of spaces or tabs to match your style (or Python’s required 4 spaces).

In both **Python** and **Vim**, **proper indentation** is crucial because it helps structure your code logically, making it easier to read and avoiding errors. Python's use of indentation isn't just style — it’s part of the **syntax**.
