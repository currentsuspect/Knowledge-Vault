To begin, let’s clarify what ethical hacking is. At its core, ethical hacking involves using the same techniques that malicious hackers use, but with permission and for defensive purposes. It's about finding and fixing vulnerabilities before the bad guys exploit them. Think of it like being a digital locksmith, testing and securing systems to prevent unauthorized access.

Ethical hackers, also known as white hats, help organizations strengthen their security posture by conducting controlled attacks or assessments, often known as penetration tests (pen tests).
### **First: Networking Fundamentals Recap**

Before we get hands-on with the tools, let's make sure we have a solid foundation in networking:

#### **Key Networking Concepts to Cover:**
1. **[[IP Addresses]]:** Understand IPv4 vs. IPv6, public vs. private IPs, and subnetting.
2. **[[Ports and Protocols]]:** Know what ports are, common ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS), and protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.
3. **[[OSI Model]]:** Learn the 7 layers and how they help in understanding where different types of network communication happen.
4. **[[DNS and HTTP Basics]]:** Understand how domain names are resolved to IP addresses and the basics of HTTP requests and responses.
5. **[[Basic Networking Commands]]:** Get comfortable with commands like `ping`, `traceroute`, `ipconfig`/`ifconfig`, and `netstat`.

#### **My First Set of Tasks:**

 - [ ] 1. **Learn About IP Addresses and Subnetting:**
   - An **IP address** is a unique identifier for a device on a network. It allows devices to find and communicate with each other.
   - **IPv4** (like `192.168.1.1`) is the most common format, with four sets of numbers ranging from 0 to 255.
   - **IPv6** is newer, with a longer, more complex format (like `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`), designed to provide a much larger address space.
   - **Subnetting** divides a network into smaller, more manageable sections or subnets. This helps improve network performance and security.
   
   **Task:** Research and write down in your own words: What is subnetting, and why is it important in networking?

- [ ] 2. **Hands-On with Basic Commands:**
   - **`ping`**: Sends ICMP echo requests to test if a network device is reachable. 
     - Try running: `ping google.com` and note what happens.
   - **`traceroute` (or `tracert` on Windows):** Shows the path that packets take to reach a destination.
     - Try running: `traceroute google.com` and observe the output.
   - **`netstat`**: Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc.
     - Run: `netstat -a` and explore the different types of connections shown.

3. **Install and Use Wireshark:**
   - **Wireshark** is a packet analyzer used to capture and inspect the data flowing through a network.
   - **Task:** Install Wireshark on your system (`sudo pacman -S wireshark-qt`), capture some local network traffic, and identify basic protocols like HTTP, DNS, etc.

4. **Get Started with `nmap`:**
   - **`nmap`** (Network Mapper) is used for network discovery and security auditing. It can scan a range of IP addresses to discover hosts and services on a network.
   - **Task:** Install `nmap` (`sudo pacman -S nmap`) and start with a basic scan:
     - Run: `nmap -sn <your_local_network>` (replace `<your_local_network>` with your subnet, like `192.168.1.0/24`).
     - This will do a simple ping scan to discover active hosts. Note down the results.

### Questions to Test Your Understanding:

1. **What does the OSI model help us understand in networking?** Describe one or two layers and their functions.
2. **What’s the difference between TCP and UDP?** When might each be used?
3. **Why might you want to use a tool like `nmap`?** Give an example scenario where `nmap` would be useful.

Once you tackle these, we'll start diving deeper into using tools like `nmap` and `Wireshark` for more specific tasks, moving toward more complex topics like vulnerability scanning, penetration testing techniques, and understanding how exploits work.
