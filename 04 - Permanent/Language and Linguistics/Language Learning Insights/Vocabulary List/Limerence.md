### **Word**: Limerence

- **Definition**: An intense emotional state involving obsessive thoughts, idealization, and longing for emotional reciprocation from a person, often accompanied by strong romantic feelings. Unlike simple infatuation, *limerence* is characterized by a compulsive need for the other person to return one’s feelings.

- **Antonyms**: Disinterest, detachment, indifference, platonic love

- **Etymology**: Coined by psychologist Dorothy Tennov in her 1979 book *Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love.* The term was created to describe the specific kind of intense, often unrequited romantic desire that she observed in her studies.

- **Pronunciation**: LIM-er-uhns

- **Memory Hook**: Imagine someone whose thoughts are completely consumed by a person they adore, thinking about them all the time and yearning for their attention—this is *limerence* in action.

- **Examples in Sentences**:
  1. Her *limerence* for him was so intense that she could hardly focus on anything else.
  2. Limerence can be both exhilarating and painful, especially when the feelings are not reciprocated.
