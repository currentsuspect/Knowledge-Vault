### **Word**: Cynic

- **Definition**: A person who is skeptical or distrustful of others' motives, often believing that people are primarily motivated by self-interest rather than genuine intentions. A cynic generally assumes that people's actions are driven by selfishness and tends to question the sincerity of social and moral norms.

- **Synonyms**: Skeptic, pessimist, doubter, misanthrope, realist (in some contexts)

- **Antonyms**: Optimist, idealist, believer, trusting person

- **Etymology**: The term comes from the Greek *kynikos*, which means “dog-like” or “cynical,” originally used to describe the followers of the ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes of Sinope, who lived ascetically and questioned social norms. Over time, it evolved to describe a general attitude of distrust and skepticism.

- **Pronunciation**: SIN-ik

- **Memory Hook**: Think of a *cynic* as someone who always expects the "worst" from people, like a detective who assumes everyone has something to hide.

- **Examples in Sentences**:
  1. Her *cynic* attitude made it hard for her to believe that anyone could be genuinely altruistic.
  2. The politician’s promises were met with *cynic* skepticism by the public, who had heard similar pledges before.

- **Personal Connection**: I find that while a *cynic* approach can help in questioning motives and avoiding disillusionment, it’s important to balance skepticism with an open mind to avoid missing out on genuine connections and opportunities.
