### **Word**: Retribution

- **Definition**: Punishment that is considered morally right and fully deserved, often given in response to a wrong or criminal act. It implies a form of justice where the severity of the punishment matches the severity of the offense.
    
- **Synonyms**: Revenge, punishment, payback, vengeance, recompense
    
- **Antonyms**: Forgiveness, mercy, leniency, pardon
    
- **Etymology**: Derived from the Latin word _retributio_, which means "repayment," coming from _re-_ (back) and _tribuere_ (to pay or assign). This etymology reflects the idea of paying back or returning in kind.
    
- **Pronunciation**: reh-truh-BYOO-shuhn
    
- **Memory Hook**: Think of _retribution_ as the universe’s way of “balancing the scales,” where every action gets a reaction, especially when it comes to justice or revenge.
    
- **Examples in Sentences**:
    
    1. The villagers sought _retribution_ against those who had wronged them, believing that justice needed to be served.
    2. He feared _retribution_ from his former allies after betraying them.
- **Personal Connection**: I see _retribution_ as a double-edged sword—it can serve justice, but it can also perpetuate a cycle of conflict if driven by revenge rather than fairness.
