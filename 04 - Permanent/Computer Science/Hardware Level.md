**"Hardware level"** refers to the foundational layer of a computer system, consisting of physical components (hardware) like the **CPU, memory (RAM), storage devices, and peripherals**. These components operate at the most fundamental level, directly executing instructions via **machine code** and interacting with each other through electrical signals and binary logic. When we talk about programming or operations at the hardware level, we usually mean operations that interact directly with the physical machine, bypassing abstraction layers like the operating system or high-level programming languages.

### **Key Topics in The Notes:**

1. **Computer Architecture**:
   - How hardware components (CPU, RAM, etc.) are organized and interact.
   - Includes **registers**, **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**, **control unit**, and **buses**.
   - Difference between **Von Neumann** and **Harvard architectures**.

2. **[[Machine Code|Machine Code & Assembly]]**:
   - Machine code as the lowest level of software that interacts directly with the hardware.
   - How machine code gets converted from **high-level programming languages**.
   - Writing assembly language programs for direct hardware control.

3. **CPU Architecture**:
   - **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: Set of commands the CPU understands (e.g., **x86**, **ARM**).
   - Explanation of **32-bit vs. 64-bit** CPUs and how they process data.
   - Understanding of **registers**, **caches**, and **pipelines** within the CPU.

4. **Memory & Storage**:
   - How **RAM** (volatile memory) works at the hardware level.
   - **Non-volatile storage** (HDDs, SSDs), and how they interact with the CPU.
   - **Memory addressing**, virtual memory, and paging.

5. **Input/Output (I/O) Operations**:
   - How the CPU communicates with peripherals like keyboards, mice, and displays.
   - Role of **I/O controllers** and device drivers.
   - **Interrupts** and how hardware signals attention to the CPU.

6. **Networking Hardware**:
   - Basics of **network interfaces**, **routers**, and **switches**.
   - How data moves physically across a network using network cards, wires, and protocols.

7. **Power & Circuitry**:
   - How power flows through the system and is regulated.
   - Importance of **heat management** in processors.
   
### **Related Fields** :

- **Computer Systems**: In-depth on how operating systems manage hardware resources.
- **Digital Logic**: The basics of how hardware uses logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) to perform calculations.
- **Embedded Systems**: Programming close to hardware in devices like **microcontrollers** and **IoT** devices.
- **Low-Level Programming**: Programming in **C** or **assembly** to interact more closely with hardware.
