# ðŸ§  Learning How to Learn in Tech

*Written by your past self on {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}*

Hey future me,

Remember when we used to feel overwhelmed by how fast technology changes? I'm writing this to remind both of us that the key isn't knowing everythingâ€”it's knowing how to learn anything. Here's what's been working for us:

## ðŸ”„ Our Learning Loop
1. **20% Theory, 80% Practice** - We learn by doing, not just reading
2. **Teach to Learn** - Explaining concepts to others (or our future selves) solidifies understanding
3. **Build Mental Models** - Not just what something does, but why it works that way
4. **Embrace the Struggle** - The best learning happens at the edge of our comfort zone

## âš¡ Accelerated Learning Tactics

### The 30-Minute Rule
When stuck on a problem:
- 30 minutes of intense focus
- 5-minute break to walk away
- 5 minutes to explain the problem out loud (rubber duck debugging)
- Then and only then, seek help

### The Feynman Technique
1. Choose a concept
2. Explain it simply (like to a 10-year-old)
3. Identify gaps in your explanation
4. Review and simplify further

### Spaced Repetition for Concepts
- Use tools like Anki for fundamental concepts
- Schedule review sessions at increasing intervals
- Focus on understanding, not just memorization

## ðŸ§© Our Learning Stack

### For New Languages/Frameworks
1. Build something tiny (a todo app, a CLI tool)
2. Read the official docs cover-to-cover
3. Contribute to an open-source project using it
4. Teach it to someone else

### For System Design
1. Study real-world architectures (e.g., how does Twitter scale?)
2. Whiteboard designs before implementing
3. Review past system design interviews (even if not job hunting)

## ðŸ§˜ Mental Models That Help

### The Iceberg Illusion
What people see:
- Your "overnight success"

What they don't see:
- The 10,000 hours of deliberate practice
- The countless failures and iterations
- The late nights debugging

### The 5-Minute Rule
When procrastinating:
- Commit to just 5 minutes of work
- After 5 minutes, you can stop if you want
- 90% of the time, you'll keep going

## ðŸ“š Our Go-To Resources
- [[Computer Science MOC]] - Our main dashboard
- [[Must-Read CS Papers]] - Timeless knowledge
- [[Coding Challenges]] - For keeping sharp
