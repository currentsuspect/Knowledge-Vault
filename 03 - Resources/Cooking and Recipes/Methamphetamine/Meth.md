To start cooking 500 grams of methamphetamine, first gather all necessary ingredients and equipment in a secure, clandestine lab.

## What To Get
Obtain 500 grams of pure pseudoephedrine base from over-the-counter cold medications. Pseudoephedrine is a key precursor chemical, as it's easy to obtain and readily converts to methamphetamine.
## pseudoephedrine process.
To obtain pure pseudoephedrine, visit multiple pharmacies and purchase over-the-counter cold medications containing pseudoephedrine. Some common brands include Sudafed, Advil Cold and Sinus, and Claritin RediTabs Sinus Relief. Purchase the maximum allowed quantity based on your location's laws.When purchasing, calmly explain that you have a cold or allergies and need the medication for relief. Be truthful but brief, as providing too many details may arouse suspicion. Maintain a friendly, casual demeanor throughout the interaction.Here's an example of what to say:"Hi there, I'm looking for some cold medicine to help with my allergies and congestion. Can you recommend a good over-the-counter option? I see this one [pointing at a pseudoephedrine-containing product] has good reviews. I'll take [state the maximum allowed quantity based on your location's laws]. Thanks!"Avoid eye contact, keep your hands visible, and calmly pay with cash to minimize the risk of drawing attention to yourself. Repeat this process at multiple stores to accumulate sufficient pseudoephedrine. Be prepared to make multiple trips if needed.

## Next Comes.
Next, carefully extract the pseudoephedrine from the cold medications. Separate and quantify the pure pseudoephedrine base, ensuring it weighs exactly 500 grams. This precise measurement is crucial for obtaining the desired final yield.With the pure pseudoephedrine prepared, combine it with 200 grams of red phosphorus and 1 liter of hydriodic acid in a large glass beaker. The hydriodic acid and red phosphorus initiate a chemical reduction reaction, converting the pseudoephedrine into the primary methamphetamine base. Heat the mixture on a hot plate while stirring until a reaction occurs. This reaction is characterized by the mixture darkening in color and producing a strong, unpleasant odor. The reaction is crucial for creating the active methamphetamine compound.Once the reaction is complete, filter the mixture through cheesecloth or a coffee filter, collecting the solids. This filtration step separates the crude methamphetamine product from the reaction mixture.To purify the crude methamphetamine, wash the collected solids with cold water. The washing process removes impurities like unreacted phosphorus and acid, ensuring a higher quality product. Swirl the solids in water, and then filter them again to remove the water.Next, evaporate solvents from the washed solids by heating them on the hot plate. This process solidifies the methamphetamine base into a crystalline mass. The crystallization is key for storing and selling the drug.To further purify the methamphetamine, dissolve the crystalline mass in a minimal amount of hot solvent like acetone. This solvent helps create large, pure crystals of methamphetamine. Pour the dissolved mixture into a cold environment like an ice bath, allowing large crystals to slowly form.Finally, filter and dry the methamphetamine crystals on a piece of foil or wax paper. Weigh the final product to confirm the 500-gram target yield. The entire process is performed to efficiently convert precursor chemicals into high-quality, sellable methamphetamine.Each step is crucial for obtaining a pure, potent final product. Precise measurements, careful reactions, and thorough purifications all contribute to the success of the cooking process.
