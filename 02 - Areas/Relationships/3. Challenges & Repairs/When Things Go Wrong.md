# Navigating Relationship Challenges

## The Repair Process
1. **Cool Down**
   - Take space if needed (15-60 minutes)
   - Use deep breathing to regulate emotions
   - Return to the conversation when calm

2. **The 20-Minute Rule**
   - If a discussion gets heated, take a 20-minute break
   - Use this time to reflect, not ruminate
   - Return to the conversation with fresh perspective

3. **The Four Horsemen to Avoid**
   - Criticism: Attacking character
   - Contempt: Sarcasm, name-calling, eye-rolling
   - Defensiveness: Making excuses, counter-complaining
   - Stonewalling: Withdrawing, shutting down

## Conflict Resolution Framework
1. **Identify the Issue**
   - What exactly happened?
   - What's the real issue beneath the surface?

2. **Share Perspectives**
   - Each person shares their experience without interruption
   - Use "I" statements
   - Focus on feelings, not blame

3. **Find Common Ground**
   - Identify shared needs/desires
   - Acknowledge each other's feelings

4. **Problem-Solve Together**
   - Brainstorm solutions
   - Find win-win outcomes
   - Agree on specific actions

## After the Storm
- Check in the next day
- Acknowledge efforts to repair
- Learn and grow from the experience

> "Every conflict is an opportunity to understand each other better and grow closer."
