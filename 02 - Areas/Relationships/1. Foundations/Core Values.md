# Core Values in Our Relationship

Our relationship is built on four foundational values. Each value has its own page with deeper exploration and practical applications:

1. [[Honesty]] - The bedrock of trust in our relationship
2. [[Growth]] - Committing to personal and shared evolution
3. [[Adventure]] - Embracing new experiences together
4. [[Respect]] - Honoring each other's individuality

## How These Values Work Together
These values are interconnected and support each other. For example, [[Honesty]] creates the safety needed for [[Growth]], while [[Respect]] ensures that our [[Adventure]]s strengthen rather than strain our bond.
