**Observations**

1. **Memory Strength**: I’ve got a surprisingly good memory. Yesterday, I remembered a lot of things I thought I’d forgotten, like videos I watched and names of people from 10 years ago. It’s wild how much detail my mind holds onto without me realizing it.

2. **The Challenge of Documenting**: Documenting life is harder than I thought. There’s a fine line between capturing moments and actually experiencing them. I’m trying to get as much down as I can, but I don’t want it to pull me away from the moment itself.

3. **Limited Knowledge**: For all the years I’ve lived—20 so far—I’m realizing how little I actually know about the world. It’s humbling, almost like there’s this vast expanse of knowledge I haven’t even scratched the surface of.

I need to keep learning at my own pace and continue doing things in a way that feels right to me. I’m slowly figuring things out, but at the same time, I’m aware that there’s always more to uncover. It’s like solving one puzzle just opens up another, but that’s all part of it. I’ve got to trust my process and stay curious—everything else will fall into place eventually.
