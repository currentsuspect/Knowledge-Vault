### **Rollercoaster of Switching OS: A Note on Self-Discovery**

#### **The Situation:**
Recently, I found myself switching from Arch Linux to Windows, mainly driven by my desire to work with FL Studio, which isn’t natively available on Linux. I thought this switch would streamline my music production process, giving me the tools I needed without the hassle. But as soon as I booted into Windows, everything felt off. The familiar shortcut keys for Hyprland were suddenly useless, and navigating through Windows felt like I was operating in someone else’s world. I was missing that feeling of being fully in sync with my setup—an environment I had carefully crafted to match my workflow, my creativity, and my way of thinking.

#### **Switching Back:**
So, after giving it a shot, I switched back to Arch Linux. And instantly, it felt like I was back in my own skin, back to knowing what I was doing with my life. It was like being reunited with a part of myself that I had temporarily lost. It wasn’t just about the OS—it was about feeling purposeful, connected, and in control of my space. It got me thinking deeply about what this all meant.

#### **What Does This Mean?**
This experience taught me something important about growth and comfort zones. Getting out of your comfort zone can feel alien and jarring, but it’s essential for growth. That discomfort isn’t a signal of failure; it’s a sign that you’re expanding your boundaries. And while it would have been easy to stay on Windows and adjust over time, I realized that sometimes it's okay not to be ready for that leap yet. Maybe this is an excuse, my inner voice whispers. But I don’t think so.

#### **Stretching, Not Popping, My Comfort Zone:**
It’s not about loving my comfort zone so much that I never leave it—far from it. I actively push myself into tough situations, constantly testing my limits and expanding my comfort zone little by little. This isn’t about popping it altogether and feeling lost; it’s about stretching it until the whole world becomes my comfort zone. Each new challenge—whether switching OSes, diving into unfamiliar environments, or trying to redefine my routines—helps me see the world from a broader perspective. And eventually, these small stretches mean that the unknown doesn’t feel so unknown anymore. 

For now, I’m back where I feel most like myself, and that’s okay. I’m still growing, still exploring, and still learning to connect with the world in ways that feel right to me. And who knows—maybe one day, the unfamiliar will feel as natural as this does now.
