### **[Intro] Analysis**

The intro sets the stage for a confrontational tone with lines like "Gotta bring it to you cowards," implying that something intense is about to go down. The use of "cowards" creates an immediate opposition, and the artist seems ready to deliver a raw and aggressive narrative. The phrase "it's gonna be sicker than all the niggas" implies a promise to outdo everyone else, suggesting a blend of braggadocio and a warning.

### **[Verse 1] Analysis**

This verse is filled with raw, vivid imagery and references, giving insight into a rough upbringing and a violent, street-oriented lifestyle.

- **"You can tell a nigga like me ain't never had shit"**  
  Right away, the artist is letting us know about their struggle. This opening line establishes a background of poverty and hardship, setting the context for the following lines.

- **"R.I.P., I miss my dawgs like Mike Vick"**  
  This line references NFL player Michael Vick, who was famously involved in a dogfighting scandal. "Dawgs" serves a double entendre: it could refer to his friends (often called "dawgs" in slang) and also reference the dogs that were central to Vick's controversy.

- **"Zombies in that midnight fog, them bars sick 'em"**  
  "Zombies in the midnight fog" creates a dark, haunting atmosphere, suggesting people moving aimlessly or acting out of desperation in dire situations. "Bars sick 'em" is a wordplay that ties back to Vick's dogfighting, with "sick 'em" being a command to attack, while also talking about his rap ("bars") as aggressive or 'sick.'

- **"Fall victim to a gun brawl, started over some bitches, huh"**  
  This line illustrates the violence that can erupt over trivial issues, here using "bitches" which might refer to women or petty disagreements. It portrays a world where conflicts can quickly escalate to deadly outcomes.

- **"The irony when a nigga's starvin', gotta grip the biscuit"**  
  The "biscuit" is slang for a gun, but it also plays on the hunger motif — when you're starving, you might grip a "biscuit" for sustenance, but here it’s a gun for survival.

- **"Jump the fence, empty all the dishes out your kitchen"**  
  This visual captures desperation-driven crime, suggesting someone breaking into a house to steal food or valuables. It's raw and reflects a sense of survival by any means.

- **"If you witness it, then click, click, click, and they spill the grits"**  
  "Click, click, click" mimics the sound of a gun, and "spill the grits" could reference blood spilling — another wordplay that ties back to poverty and food imagery.

- **"First take go to first base, Stephen A. Smith Wess' / On the hip, talkin' shit like Skip"**  
  These lines reference ESPN sports commentators Stephen A. Smith and Skip Bayless, who are known for their loud and provocative debating style. "First take" is also the name of the show. "Wess’" is short for a Smith & Wesson gun, playing on the word "Smith." This imagery shows that just like the commentators, the artist is ready to “shoot” (rap) with energy and force.

- **"Sharp-shootin' off the top of the cliff"**  
  Wordplay here on Shannon Sharpe (also a sports commentator), suggesting that he’s a sharpshooter, meaning precise in his words or actions.

- **"Zone-6, five fingers with the 'Suck my dick'"**  
  "Zone-6" refers to an area in East Atlanta, a place known for its tough, gritty environment. "Five fingers" might suggest a fist or possibly the local hand gesture (flipping off) as a sign of defiance.

### **[Chorus] Analysis**

- **"When you fall down, stand up, get a bandage"**  
  A line that reflects resilience — no matter how hard you fall, you’ve got to get back up and keep going.

- **"I ain't got cheeseburger money, make a sandwich"**  
  Speaks to the poverty and resourcefulness of making do with what you have. It shows the mother’s practical wisdom in raising kids in a tough environment.

- **"Why you bein' bad? See ya dad, get your ass whipped"**  
  Reflects the harsh discipline of the household, a common reality in many low-income families where strict upbringing is seen as necessary to survive in a rough environment.

- **"Seven crackhead bad kids in a caravan"**  
  This line paints a chaotic, yet oddly affectionate picture of a large family with limited resources. The term “crackhead” may not be literal but could be used to describe how wild or out-of-control the kids seem.

### **[Verse 2] Analysis**

- **"Metaphysical things seen in dreams, what you believe?"**  
  The artist is diving into deeper, abstract territory, questioning the nature of belief and reality. He’s suggesting that he’s had visions or insights beyond the ordinary.

- **"I'm a fuckin' artiste, Artest with the gun / I can give my world peace, give your world ether"**  
  A clever wordplay on Ron Artest, a former NBA player who changed his name to Metta World Peace. The artist claims he can either bring peace or destruction ("ether" — a reference to the Nas track famous for its diss). It plays on the idea of being both creative and destructive.

- **"Big dick or grief, I can give your girl either"**  
  Crude but effective wordplay; he’s boasting about his potency, both physically and emotionally.

- **"But king's gotta peep the seat, word to Caesar"**  
  Refers to the historical betrayal of Julius Caesar, warning that even those in power need to watch their back.
