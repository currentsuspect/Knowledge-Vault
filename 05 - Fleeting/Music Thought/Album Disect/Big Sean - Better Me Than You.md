### NOTES ON THE ALBUM BEFORE LISTENING

**Album**: *Better Me Than You* is the 6th studio album from Big Sean, the Detroit rapper who I just realized today is repping Motor City. 

- **[Album Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihPhl2NheqE)**

- **Songs I've Heard from Big Sean**: "Sacrifices" (feat. Migos), "Lithuania" (feat. Travis Scott), "I Don't Fuck With You," "I KNOW" (feat. Jhené Aiko), and "No Favors" (feat. Eminem). All banger so far—I'm hoping he brings that same vibe to *Better Me Than You*. If he does, he might just rocket onto my list of favorite artists. Never listened to a full Big Sean album, so I’m kind of jumping in blind here, but I’m down for the ride.

## TRACK 1 - "PRESSURE (INTRO)"

Big Sean kicks off with this intense intro, and right away, you can feel the tension like a fist tightening around your chest. The opening is like a chaotic collage of voices—people hitting him from all sides. 

- **Voices of Judgment**: First, there’s this dude who comes in hot, asking, "Where you been at, bro?" He’s got that mix of frustration and expectation, like Sean’s been AWOL. Then we get a switch-up—someone complaining, "Always in the studio but ain't never with your son." This sounds personal, like maybe his partner or someone close who’s got a bone to pick. 

- **The City’s Calling**: Then you’ve got the city pulling him back in. "The city fuckin' with you right now, bruh," but also "Niggas talkin' crazy about you in the hood, bro." It’s like they’re saying, “You’re loved, but you’re also slipping.” And the line, "I just seen yo' daddy drive a Uber, dog, what's good?" is a gut punch, calling out his real-world responsibilities, maybe even shame. Feels like a reminder that while Sean’s chasing his dreams, there are still things at home that might need attention.

- **Contradictory Demands**: The voices then throw out wild contradictions: "You need to figure your shit out," "You need one of them anthems," "You need to diss someone," "You should just disappear." It’s like they want him to be everything at once: the hero, the villain, the ghost. And finally, the woman’s voice says, "I miss you, the real you." It’s that classic tug between being true to oneself and the expectations everyone else has. 

- **Sean's Response**: But Big Sean isn’t having it. He cuts through with, "You don't miss me, bitch." This line feels like a grenade tossed right back at the noise—he’s not about to conform or get pulled down by anyone else's opinions.

### OVERALL VIBE

Big Sean is setting the stage with a lot of *pressure* (pun intended) from all directions—society, what I'm assuming is his partner(Jhene Aiko), his inner critic, maybe even fans and critics. Everyone wants something from him, and they’re not even aligned in what they want. It’s a battle between his own desires and the chaos of external demands. You can feel he’s torn between wanting to prove himself and just telling everyone to back off.

### What I Might Have Missed : Added After Research.

1. **Duality of Fame and Reality**: The line about his dad driving a Uber hits hard—it's like, yeah, he's in the studio hustling, but there are real-world struggles he can't ignore. It grounds the whole track in a way that’s raw and real, setting up a theme that might run throughout the album: balancing success with staying true to his roots.

2. **Language of Conflict**: Notice how these voices are always at odds? "We speaking two totally different languages." That’s more than just saying they’re not on the same page—it’s like Sean’s on a different plane altogether, trying to do something deeper while everyone else is stuck in their lane.

3. **Self-Assertion in Defiance**: Sean’s final line isn’t just angry; it’s a reclaiming of his identity. He’s not letting anyone else define who he is or what he should be doing. That "bitch" feels almost like a rejection of the false love or shallow expectations placed on him. He’s coming into this album ready to speak his truth.

## TRACK 2: "ICONIC"

### First Impressions

Man, the beat on this track is *fire*! The production is next-level, pulling you in with a vibe that screams "pay attention." It's got that head-nodding, windows-down, cruising-through-the-city feel to it. You know you're in for something big just from the first few seconds.

### Lyrical Breakdown

- **People Copying His Style**: He’s calling out all the biters—the people trying to imitate his sound, his flow, his whole vibe. It's a flex, but also a warning: don't sleep on him or think you can ride his wave without putting in the work he did.

- **Not a New Artist**: Sean’s setting the record straight—he's not some rookie just stepping onto the scene. He’s been here, paid his dues, and made his mark. If you’re confusing him for a new artist, you’re not paying attention.

- **Peons**: Now, this is where it gets interesting. So, I looked it up, and "peons" refers to low-ranking workers or servants—basically, people who have no real power or influence. Sean’s making it clear he’s above all that; he’s not here to be treated like he’s at the bottom rung of the ladder.

- **Not Fazed by Fakeness**: Sean’s brushing off the haters and the fake friends—anyone who's trying to bring negativity his way. He’s on his own level, or as he puts it, “his fakeness.” He’s unbothered, living his truth, and not playing games with anyone who’s not on his wavelength.

- **Might Style Your Stylist**: This line is pure swagger. He’s saying that he’s so influential that he might as well start styling the people who style others. It's another way of claiming his status as a trendsetter—people copy him, and then they still need his guidance to get it right.

- **Rap Like They Acting All Shiggy**: Now, this is a fun one. The "Shiggy" reference likely points to The Shiggy Show, a popular comedian and dancer who went viral with the #InMyFeelings challenge (think Drake's song and everyone dancing to it on social media). Sean's comparing other rappers to Shiggy, suggesting they’re just putting on a show—acting out and following trends rather than being authentic. It's a way of calling them out for being performers rather than true artists.

> One of if not my favorite so far.
### Overall Vibe

Sean’s in his bag on this one. "ICONIC" is all about standing his ground, asserting his dominance, and reminding everyone who he is and what he brings to the table. He’s got no time for imitators, no patience for fakes, and no interest in anything less than greatness. He's making it clear that if you’re not original, you're just playing a role—and he's not here for it.

## TRACK 3: “TYPECAST”
**Typecast:** represent or regard (a person or their role) as fitting a particular stereotype.

Wait he wrote a book? (go higher) not released apparently but it seems he has taken his advice

lol: Every day I wake up, I'm one day closer to death  
So what you gon' do with the time you got left?  
Ball on these pussies, damn, look at my neck.

### TRACK 5: "Who You Are (Superstar)" 

**Intro:**
The intro sets a dreamy yet direct tone, with Big Sean expressing commitment and constant availability. The line "Callin' my number one, Front row at your audience" hints at his dedication to being there for someone he deeply admires. Despite the fame and attention, there's a sense of loneliness emphasized with "All these cameras and you still alone." This could reflect the isolation that often comes with stardom. Sean is always "on" and available, echoing his devotion to this person.

**Chorus:**
The chorus reinforces the theme of being a superstar and understanding one's worth. Big Sean acknowledges the power and influence of his muse: "These bitches finna hate you, you a superstar." He appreciates the journey from "who you was" to "who you are," implying growth, transformation, and self-realization. The mention of mood boards suggests that this person is an icon or an inspiration, and Sean expresses his admiration in a confident, almost playful manner with lines like, "When I flick you from the back, you a superstar." There's an intimate vibe in his lyrics, mixing elements of sexual tension with deeper respect and understanding of the person’s identity and power.

**Verse 1:**
This verse delves deeper into the intimate and personal relationship. He portrays a luxurious and intimate lifestyle: "Your face buried in silk, I hop, I'm on top, I'm the king of the hill." The imagery of silk and being at the top evokes a sense of luxury and dominance. He emphasizes his partner’s desirability and the admiration others have for her, like an ex still wanting her. Sean aligns himself with her energy and mirrors her sex drive, which shows a connection on both a physical and emotional level. He even suggests she deserves more than just a relationship — "She deserve a tail number and a Telfar," implying she deserves a private jet and high-end fashion, metaphorically speaking to her value and status. 

There's a contrast between Big Sean and other men ("I'm not that nigga that you call that's never answering"), which highlights his reliability and commitment. He’s positioning himself as someone who understands her worth and potential, unlike others who might have failed to appreciate her. The verse ends with a humorous, self-aware line about them possibly having a "superstar kid," merging the playful with the serious in terms of relationship goals.

**Chorus (Reprise):**
The chorus is repeated to reinforce the central theme of the person’s star quality and authenticity. Sean praises her uniqueness and refuses to let the haters affect her shine. This part is both a celebration and a reminder of her true self and power.

**Verse 2:**
In the second verse, Big Sean expands on the idea of his muse needing support rather than just admiration. He emphasizes the need for a "platform" and "somebody who gon' go to bat for her," suggesting that she needs someone who will champion her efforts and talent, not just someone to idolize her. The lines "All she need is somebody who gon' go to bat for her, Soon as she leave the house, make her back for her" emphasize the importance of loyalty and support.

He uses imagery of a sold-out show jumping "like a pep rally" to illustrate her magnetic presence. This verse also contains humorous yet sensual lines like, "Pussy fire, I might have to go no shirt mode," reflecting his admiration and attraction while blending confidence with self-awareness. The reference to religious figures, "I know Creflo and Kirk know," subtly points to her being a blessing in his life and her importance in his personal journey. The line, "You a superstar, just never go commercial," implies that while she shines brightly, she should stay authentic and true to herself.

**Bridge (The-Dream):**
The-Dream’s bridge adds a dreamy, soulful element to the song. He reflects on how special this person is, noting how they "don't ever happen to people like me." It adds a layer of humility and awe, portraying the muse as someone extraordinary. The line "You can be anywhere but you where you wanna be" speaks to her independence and the choice to remain grounded and authentic despite opportunities to be elsewhere. This section adds emotional depth, illustrating a sense of gratitude and admiration.

**Outro Chorus and Outro:**
The outro chorus serves as a final, emphatic declaration of this person’s superstar status and the intimacy of their connection. It’s about recognizing her worth and staying authentic. The outro lines reiterate the themes of devotion and presence, “My phone is always on, I'm always yours," highlighting a promise of unwavering support and availability.

### Added Insights
1. **Themes of Fame and Authenticity:** The song deals heavily with the themes of fame and maintaining authenticity. Big Sean uses "superstar" as both a compliment and a reminder to stay true to oneself. It contrasts public admiration with personal relationships and internal conflicts.
   
2. **Interplay of Admiration and Intimacy:** There's a consistent interplay between admiration and intimacy. Big Sean admires the person for who they are while also exploring deeper, personal connections. The lyrics switch between public adoration and private moments, creating a dynamic view of the person as both a public figure and a private muse.

3. **Empowerment and Support:** Throughout, there’s a strong message of empowerment and support. Sean emphasizes being there for his muse, not just as a lover, but as someone who understands and supports her potential, whether it’s professionally ("You don't need a man, you need a manager") or emotionally.

4. **Contrast of the Private and Public Self:** The repeated lines and themes about knowing "who you were" and "who you are" suggest a journey from past to present. It explores the complexities of being both a public figure (a superstar) and a private individual, with all the attendant conflicts and contradictions.

5. **Clever Wordplay and References:** Big Sean’s lyrics are filled with clever wordplay and references that merge the pop culture of today with deeper metaphorical meanings, such as the references to "mood boards" and "Met Gala." He balances a contemporary, modern vibe with a focus on timeless human emotions like love, ambition, and authenticity.

Overall, the song is a celebration of individuality, star quality, and authenticity in both love and life. It reinforces the idea that true connection goes beyond public perception and superficiality, finding depth in genuine understanding and support.

> A favorite for sure!
