## TRACK 1 - “GreenLight” Review

---
Molly Santana comes in heavy on *GreenLight*, setting the tone with confidence and energy. From the first beat, you can feel the weight of the 808s, paired with crisp fast hi-hats at the chorus that create this hypnotic vibe. What really stands out is the way the bass feels almost like it’s singing along, giving the track that wavy, immersive sound. It’s one of those songs where, if you’ve got the right speakers, it’s less about just listening and more about feeling it.

---

And let’s talk about the adlibs—super infectious. They add this layer of emotion that just amps the track up, even if half the time you’re not entirely sure what she’s saying (especially around the 0:29 mark), but that’s part of the vibe, right? It’s raw, it’s hyped, it works.

---

Lyrically, Molly isn’t just making a casual entrance—she’s marking her territory. There’s no holding back, especially with lines like:  
**“Molly roll around the block like dice / Swear I'm wearing these hoes out every time I get dressed.”**

---

The double entendres in that line are crazy, flexing her street smarts and her ability to dominate the game on her terms. She’s letting everyone know she’s a problem, not just in how she moves but in how she carries herself. The delivery itself has this punch to it that screams, "I'm here, and I’m not playing nice." You get the sense she’s got the green light—full speed ahead, no stopping, no looking back.

---

In the **pre-chorus**, Molly drives this message home:  
**“I don’t really wanna take it slow / You don’t gotta say, I already know.”**  
She’s not looking for anyone to tell her when to move—she’s in full control, moving at her own pace. The repetition of not wanting to “take it slow” really hammers in her relentless attitude. Then, the **chorus** hits with this warning:  
**“They gon’ try, big .45 / Leave me alone, or you die.”**  
That *big .45* line—whether literal or metaphorical—paints a clear picture of her power. It’s not just a flex; it’s a promise. Step wrong, and you're done.

---

Her flow in the **verse** is tight, almost effortless, as she drops lines like:  
**“I’m as fast as it get, uh / I been on to the jet, uh.”**  
This isn’t just about money moves—it’s about her pace. She’s out here lapping anyone who’s trying to keep up. No hesitations, no second chances—if you’re slow, you get left behind. And even in the **bridge**, where she casually mentions:  
**“Swear I’m wearing these hoes out every time I get dressed,”**  
it’s deeper than clothes. She’s talking about dressing down the competition, every single time, leaving no room for doubt.

---

The song finishes just as strong as it starts, with that “go-getter” attitude coming full circle, amplified by those vocal effects that add another layer to her intensity:  
**“I don’t really wanna take it slow / You don’t gotta say, I already know.”**

---
### TRACK 2 - "Want" Review
---

Molly Santana switches gears on *Want*, bringing a blend of house-inspired beats with hip-hop vibes for a love/breakup anthem. It’s got that smooth, laid-back energy, but it still feels raw enough to keep her edge intact. This track feels like Molly’s version of pouring her heart out at 2 AM, but with a beat that’ll still get people moving on the dancefloor.

---

The production is clean—deep synths, rhythmic claps, and a steady bassline that gives it that house groove while maintaining the hip-hop foundation. You can almost picture dimly lit clubs with neon lights pulsing to the beat, while Molly’s vocals echo around the room. There’s this hypnotic feel, but it doesn’t overpower the emotion. It’s chill but not sleepy, and it gets the job done in creating that "I’m feeling something but can’t quite figure it out" vibe.

---

The **chorus** is catchy as hell, even if the lyrics are straightforward. Repeating "You're the only one that I want" over and over might seem simple, but it digs in. It's the kind of hook that loops in your head for hours after listening, sticking around like that last text message from someone you're not over yet. The simplicity works here because it mirrors the obsession Molly’s dealing with—the kind where no matter what, your mind keeps coming back to the same person.

---

Lyrically, *Want* isn’t groundbreaking, but that’s kind of the point. It feels relatable, like she’s saying what we’ve all felt at some point. In **Verse 1**, Molly’s trying to convince this person they should stay with her, using lines like:  
**"I should be the one you're running to / Nobody can do it the way I do."**  
She’s confident, but you can hear the frustration creeping in. The **Ash Ketchum reference** where she says,  
**"I wanna get like Ash, I'm tryna catch 'em,"**  
is a little cheeky, bringing in that pop culture flair while playing with the idea of chasing something that’s always out of reach. It gives the song a playful touch in what’s otherwise a pretty serious plea for connection.

---

By **Verse 2**, she’s fully caught up in the push-and-pull dynamic of this relationship:  
**"I keep crawling back to you / You got me pressed on rewind."**  
She’s stuck in a loop, knowing it’s not good for her but unable to break away. That feeling of running back to someone despite the red flags is so human and Molly captures it without sugarcoating the pain.

---

The **chorus** keeps things simple, but the repetition reflects her emotional state—she’s locked into this person and can’t move on. The song as a whole kind of mirrors that repetition, circling back to the same feelings, like she's trapped in her own head about it. And while the track doesn’t dive too deep lyrically, the music itself keeps it moving, almost like a sonic metaphor for how we keep ourselves distracted while working through complicated emotions.

---

Overall, *Want* doesn’t break new ground in either house or hip-hop, but it doesn’t need to. Molly’s style shines through in the way she blends both genres while telling a story of emotional vulnerability. The beat will have you vibing, but it’s the honesty in her delivery that makes it stick. It's one of those songs you can play when you’re in your feelings but still want to keep the energy up—like crying in the club but in a way that feels cathartic. It’s not perfect, but it’s real, and sometimes that’s exactly what you need.

---
### TRACK 3 - "Nothing Like This" Review
---

Molly Santana delivers *Nothing Like This* with a self-assured swagger, flexing her success while staying grounded in her journey from the grind to the glow-up. The production carries that futuristic, bass-heavy bounce Molly’s becoming known for, but what really sets this track apart is her relentless flow. It’s crystal clear—no mumble, just bars—and it’s packed with punchlines and energy that makes you feel like you're riding high alongside her.

---

The **intro** immediately sets the tone with those haunting "Mmm, mmm" hums, almost like a calm before she drops into the verse. Once she’s in, she wastes no time with the flex:  
**“I cannot lose you, get ate like some food / I'm so real, baby, my hundreds all blue.”**  
She’s establishing from the jump that she’s got everything locked down—her authenticity, her money, her people. The *blue hundreds* signify success, but there’s also a deeper nod to staying true to herself, even with her wealth.

---

The **first verse** is filled with power moves and no-nonsense attitude. Molly speaks on how she’s perceived, but she’s unbothered by it, flipping the script on anyone trying to label her the villain:  
**“They been tryna paint me as a bad guy / Getting on my last nerve, got me all on crash time.”**  
You can feel the intensity in this line. It’s like she’s had enough of the criticism and is now on the attack, ready to take out anyone in her way. The **supernova line** adds an extra layer of cosmic confidence:  
**“Call me supernova how I'm floating, I'm on space time / Got more rings than Saturn and you know they not the fake kind.”**  
It’s a brag that feels larger than life, and the space metaphor gives it that weight, like Molly’s in a different stratosphere than the rest of the competition.

---

By the time we hit the **chorus**, you’re fully immersed in Molly’s world of success and freedom:  
**“You can miss me with the fake love / Only wanna talk for them paystubs.”**  
She’s making it clear that she’s all about authenticity. She’s not here for anyone pretending to be down with her just to ride her wave—if it’s not real, she’s not interested. This is emphasized again in the refrain, where she repeats:  
**“They ain't never seen nothing like this.”**  
The repetition reinforces that Molly knows she’s doing something different, something that can’t be duplicated. It’s a bold claim, but with the way she backs it up with her delivery and wordplay, you believe her.

---

In the **second verse**, Molly shifts to reflecting on how far she’s come, celebrating both personal and financial wins:  
**“Now I got rich, I could even buy my moms a crib / Now I got rich, I don’t ever really gotta trip.”**  
There’s a sense of accomplishment here that feels grounded—she’s not just bragging for the sake of it. She’s recognizing the fruits of her labor and appreciating the freedom it’s given her. Molly’s acknowledgment of future generations,  
**“I done made a way for me and my kids and grandkids,”**  
also shows she’s thinking long-term, ensuring that her success benefits not just herself, but those who come after her.

---

Overall, *Nothing Like This* is an anthem for anyone who’s had to fight for their place and come out on top. Molly’s unapologetic, confident, and crystal clear in her delivery, with a rawness that keeps her connected to the streets even as she’s soaring above it all. The beat is infectious, the bars are solid, and Molly’s flow is the real star here—cutting through with precision and energy that’s hard to ignore. It's no surprise this one’s a favorite.
