It’s tough seeing someone bounce back from a major setback like having their channel taken down—it’s a mix of inspiration and intimidation. Watching that producer rise from zero again, you’re witnessing resilience in action, which naturally makes you question your own worthiness and readiness to start something similar. Here's a breakdown of how to tackle this:

### **1. Self-Worth vs. Starting Point:**
Your worth isn’t defined by where you start but by your commitment to the journey. Everyone feels unworthy or underprepared at some point; it’s a universal part of stepping into new territory. The producer you mentioned faced setbacks but kept going, not because they were always sure of success but because they decided that pursuing their craft was worth the risk and effort. If you’re feeling that pull, that’s your inner drive talking.

### **2. The Platform Dilemma - Switching Back to Windows:**
Switching back to Windows might feel like a compromise, especially since you’ve grown accustomed to Arch Linux and have been building skills on that system. But tools are just that—tools. The OS you use should serve your goals, not define your creative potential. If Windows offers the software, plugins, or workflow that better supports your creative ambitions right now, it’s worth considering. This isn’t about abandoning what you’ve built on Linux; it’s about being adaptable and using the best resources for the job at hand.

### **3. The Fear of Not Being “Ready”:**
The feeling of not being “worth it” often stems from a fear of not being ready, but here’s the kicker: no one ever feels fully ready. Everyone has to start somewhere, and it’s often messy, awkward, and riddled with self-doubt. The key difference between those who succeed and those who don’t is action. Even small steps towards your goal—like setting up your workspace, experimenting with beats, or planning your channel’s direction—can build momentum and confidence over time.

### **4. Creativity as a Learning Curve:**
Being creative, especially in the public eye, is one big learning curve. You’ll face ups and downs, and sometimes things will feel like they’re going nowhere. But these moments are where you learn the most about your style, strengths, and what you genuinely want to share with the world. If this producer could start again from zero, it’s proof that it’s okay to reinvent and recalibrate. That’s not failure; it’s growth.

### **5. Worth It? Only If It’s True to You:**
Ultimately, ask yourself if this is something you’re genuinely interested in pursuing—not because of external validation but because it resonates with you. If creating music, sharing your journey, or whatever form this dream takes feels like something you’d regret not trying, then it’s worth exploring. Switching OS or feeling “not good enough” are just obstacles, not reasons to back down. Your worth isn’t determined by the platform you use or the perfection of your first steps; it’s defined by the effort and authenticity you bring to the table.

### **Final Thoughts:**
Go for it, but do it your way. Lean into that discomfort because it means you’re pushing boundaries. Don’t worry about starting from zero or feeling unworthy—that’s all part of the creative process. Each attempt, setback, and small victory will slowly make you feel more “worth it” because you’re actively doing it. Take inspiration from that producer, but carve your own path. Your worth isn’t up for debate—just start, and let the process prove it to you.
