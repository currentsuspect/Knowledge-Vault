# FEELINGS:
---
So I’m just getting the realization that nobody cares, like everyone out here is doing things for their own benefit and the only person or thing that isn't or probably is just that i don't know is my parents and you. so i also realized that I’ve achieved nothing since birth nothing other than studying and physical growth, its painful but true, i sit here right now with no accolades, nothing bigger than my self only me and the things that i have been handed to by my parents and I’ve for the longest time wanted this feeling to go away by producing beats, i became decent, started a channel but 6 months in i stopped as i was getting no views and only two producers were what i got out of that, then tried a relationship and got broken up with a yr ago reason being "it wasn’t you its me, I’m not ready" also I’m starting this philosophy, psychology explanations of what the world means YouTube channel as
1. an escape from all of that realization plus try earn something, also try make a community that sees the world as i see it also contradictions to see biases and something bigger than me
2. Then there is my dad who is struggling day in day out to ensure we have something to eat. I usually feel bad when he complains on how tough life is, I‘m trying to make him see the beautiful world but i can't if i can't help him financially
So I’m usually dazed by why all this happens to me and i know how to get out of this, i know what to do (I’m not talking about death lol) i feel as if I‘m the reason as to why I‘m not anywhere, I‘m inconsistent with what ever i start, I’m ambitious but don't apply my ambitions fully to see the fruits and I’m just feeling sad that all these years I’ve achieved nothing and time goes by my dad isn't getting any younger and i probably won't be able to make my dad see life as it is, complex and not only one side of the complexity but the whole of it. be honest and direct, brutally. i just need help and advise, genuine one at that.

## FRIENDS RESPONSE:
Dylan, that’s heavy, man. I can feel the weight of everything you’re carrying — the frustration, the guilt, the feeling of not being where you want to be, and seeing your dad struggle while you’re trying to figure out how to make something meaningful out of all this. 

First, let me just say it: You’re right. Most people are looking out for themselves. The world is full of self-interest, and it can feel like no one gives a damn unless they’re getting something out of it. And that’s a hard pill to swallow because you’re out here wanting to make something more, something real, something that actually matters beyond just yourself. But here’s the thing: **Nobody caring** isn’t the end of the story — it’s actually a blank canvas. It’s freedom. If nobody cares, then you’ve got nothing to lose by going after whatever the hell you want, right? It’s scary, but it’s also the most liberating thing there is.

And about this feeling of having achieved nothing? That’s not the whole truth. I know it seems like you’re standing still, like you’ve got nothing to show for all the time that’s passed, but that’s just one part of the picture. The fact that you’ve been pushing through different things — music, relationships, philosophy — shows you’re not afraid to try. You *are* out there doing things. The reason it feels like you’ve achieved nothing is because you’ve been looking for external validation — views, recognition, a perfect relationship — to tell you that you’re on the right path. When you don’t get that, it feels like you’re going nowhere. 

The problem isn’t that you’re inconsistent, lazy, or lacking ambition. It’s that you’re letting the *lack of instant results* make you think you’re on the wrong path. But meaningful things take time. All those successful people you look at and think, "Damn, they’ve got it all," went through the same shit. They were ignored, they doubted themselves, they failed, and most importantly — they kept going. Even when it seemed like nobody cared. Especially when nobody cared. 

And you mentioned your dad — that’s real pressure. Wanting to take care of him, feeling like you’re letting him down by not being in a position to help more. I get it. But think about this: Your dad doesn’t just need you to make money. He needs you to *be okay*. He needs to know that his kid is fighting, growing, and pushing forward. The way you make him see life differently isn’t just by fixing everything; it’s by showing him that you’re not giving up on yours. It’s by showing him that, even if things are tough, you’re still finding reasons to fight, reasons to create, reasons to keep going. That’s something he can look at and feel proud of, no matter what.

So here’s the brutal truth, straight up: You *are* the reason you’re not where you want to be — but that’s not a condemnation. It’s an opportunity. The reason you haven’t made it yet is because you’re expecting to be great without putting in the years of hard, boring, invisible work that greatness demands. You stop because it gets hard, because nobody’s paying attention, because it feels like the world isn’t listening. And that’s on you. You have to be okay with sucking for a while. You have to be okay with the grind, with doing the work when nobody’s clapping, when nobody’s watching, when nobody seems to care. 

You have to push through this stage where you’re not seeing results and keep going anyway. Because that’s what separates people who talk about doing things from people who actually do them. 

If you want to build a channel, a community, a life that’s bigger than you, then you have to be willing to bleed for it. You have to be willing to sit with the discomfort of not being there yet, of not being recognized yet, and still keep moving. If you start something, you need to see it through, even when it feels like it’s going nowhere. That’s the real test.

And about time passing? It’s true. Time doesn’t stop for anyone. But that’s not something to be afraid of — it’s a motivator. You’ve got time now to make things happen. You’ve got time now to take those dreams you have and put them into action. You’ve got time to fail, learn, and try again. 

So, my advice? Stop looking for a way out of this feeling. It’s here for a reason. It’s telling you something needs to change, something needs to grow. Use it. Use this pain, this frustration, this fear. Don’t numb it, don’t run from it — lean into it. Let it fuel you. Start today. Do one thing that scares you, one thing that pushes you closer to who you want to be. And then do another tomorrow. And the day after. Make inconsistency your enemy. Show up every day, not because it’s easy or because you feel like it, but because you know deep down that’s the only way you’ll ever become who you’re meant to be. 

And trust me, Dylan — you’ve got something in you worth fighting for. Don't let anyone, not even yourself, convince you otherwise.
