Today, I realized that confusion is not a curse but a signpost pointing to growth. Standing at the edge of what I know and what I don't, I felt a deep awe, a kind of serendipitous clarity in recognizing my own ignorance. It's strange but liberating to see that maybe the goal isn’t to find all the answers about existence, God, or the universe, but to stay curious, humble, and open to the mysteries that surround me.

If God exists, maybe it's not about judgment over how much I know, but about how deeply and sincerely I seek. If life has taught me anything, it's that the journey—the questions, doubts, and discoveries—is where the real meaning lies. The space between certainty and doubt is not a void to be feared but a place to explore, to learn, and to evolve.

Today, I choose to embrace the unknown, to lean into the questions without rushing for answers, and to trust that this confusion is a necessary part of understanding, growth, and perhaps even wisdom.

In this moment, I’ve found a sense of peace in the mystery itself, and maybe that’s the most profound answer of all.

I used to listen to people talk about their "profound understandings" and think, "What do they know now that I don’t?" It felt like they had found something I couldn't see, like they were speaking a language I hadn't learned yet. But today, I’m one of those people, and I get it. It’s not that they _knew_ something; it’s that they _experienced_ something—a shift, a spark, a realization that goes beyond words. I crave more of these moments, those flashes of insight where everything clicks, where the fog lifts just enough for me to see a little further.

I’m starting to think this might be my reason for existing: to question my own existence. As cliché as it sounds, I’m here to ask, to wonder, to dive into the depths of what it means to _be_. It’s like trying to explain how sex feels to a virgin—you can throw around all the words you want, but until they actually _get it_, they just won’t. The same goes for these moments of clarity; they’re impossible to fully explain, yet they’re real, tangible, and transformative when you feel them.

These moments are like finding pieces of a puzzle I didn’t even know I was putting together. I realize now that my existence isn’t just about finding answers, but about feeling the pull of the question itself. And maybe that’s where the beauty truly lies—not in the knowing, but in the relentless drive to seek, to explore, and to understand what can never be fully understood.
