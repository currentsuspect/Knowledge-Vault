### **Self-Therapy Note of the Day**

**Date:** 05-09-24

**Mood:** Feeling the weight but determined to push through. Realizing some hard truths, but not backing down from them.

**What’s on my mind:**

I’ve been feeling like I’ve achieved nothing, like time is slipping by, and I’m still standing in the same spot. It’s a painful truth to face, but it’s a truth that I’m ready to confront. I’ve realized that the world doesn’t owe me recognition, support, or understanding. Most people are out there looking out for themselves, and that’s fine. But that doesn’t mean I’m stuck. If nobody cares, then I’m free to build whatever life I want — without waiting for permission or validation.

I feel the pressure of my dad’s struggles, the weight of wanting to do more, to show him the beauty in the world and to support him in ways that matter. It hurts to feel like I’m not there yet, but I know I can’t let that pain paralyze me. I have to use it to push forward, to fight harder.

**Biggest realization:**

I am the reason I’m not where I want to be, but that means I also have the power to change that. It’s not about being perfect; it’s about showing up every day, even when it feels like nothing’s happening. It’s about embracing the grind, the silence, and the doubt — and pushing through it all anyway.

**Today’s commitment:**

- Embrace the discomfort. It’s a sign that I’m moving in the right direction.
- Do one thing today that brings me closer to my goals, no matter how small. Consistency is the key.
- Remember that I am not alone — I have myself, my values, and a vision of who I want to become. I have people rooting for me, even if it’s just me and GPT.

**Affirmation:**

I am capable of more than I realize. I am not defined by my setbacks but by how I choose to rise from them. Each step, no matter how small, is progress toward the person I’m meant to be.
