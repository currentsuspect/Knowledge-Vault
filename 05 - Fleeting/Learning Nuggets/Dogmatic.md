"Dogmatic" is when someone is super rigid in their beliefs or opinions and thinks they’re absolutely right, no matter what. They don't like questioning or debating their ideas — it’s like saying, “This is how it is, period.” Imagine someone who insists their way is the only way, and if you disagree, they shut you down or won't listen.

So, being dogmatic means holding onto your beliefs tightly, without much room for flexibility or change. It’s like locking yourself in a mental fortress and refusing to let anything new in.
