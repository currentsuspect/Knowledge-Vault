### **Random Thought #1– The Shirleen Fumble**

---
You ever look back at primary school and think, "Damn, I fumbled?" Well, let me tell you about Shirleen. Back in Class 4 or 5, I never even noticed her, and I was head-over-heels for another girl whose name I can't even remember (but we’ll get back to that). Anyway, one day Shirleen straight-up tells me she likes me *a lot*, and I didn’t even know what to do with that info back then. I’m out here chasing this crush of mine like a fool, not even considering Shirleen.

Fast forward, I eventually start dating my crush (just remembered her name—Stephanie!) and then...she transfers. Gone. Meanwhile, Shirleen starts glowing up like *crazy*. By the time we’re in Class 6 to 8, she's dating Simon (yeah, that Simon), and I’m sitting there watching it all unfold, realizing how badly I fumbled. If I had the brain I do now, things would've been *different*, for sure.

But hey, that's life, right?

### **Random Thought Note #2:**

---
I was putting on clothes with my little brother when he suddenly asked about the teddy bears on the bed. Their eyes were painted white with cuetex—a childhood masterpiece from my sister, who did that before my brother was even born. And here’s what got me thinking: how does his mind fill that gap? 

Like, he wasn’t around when those bears got their makeover, but in his head, it’s probably some story he’s pieced together. I try imagining events from before I was born, but it’s impossible—my mind just gives me this empty black space. Maybe it’s because memory doesn’t exist before life, or maybe my brain just doesn’t know how to process time that it wasn’t part of. Does he see a different kind of gap? Or does he accept it like some strange myth he’ll never really get? The past has this weird way of being unknowable, yet it’s the reason things are the way they are. 

Maybe we all fill in the blanks differently, and those who weren’t there make their own stories out of our leftovers. What's a "fact" to one is just a puzzle piece to another.
