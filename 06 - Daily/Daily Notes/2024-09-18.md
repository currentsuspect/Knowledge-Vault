# DAILY NOTE
### *Wednesday, September 18th, 2024*

## Journal
**Reminder:**  
Fridayâ€™s missionâ€”head to town to grab those items Maina mentioned and work on getting that quotation sorted.

**18-09-24:** On the road to Rongai.  

Today felt like clockwork, but in a good way. I woke up, did the usualâ€”cooked tea, drank it, and got ready for the internship. Afterward, I made my way to the workspace, where I blew through two machines and serviced them. Routineâ€™s starting to feel second nature.

**Videos Watched:**  

1. **PlaqueBoyMax:** Meeting up with Molly Santana.  
2. **Dutie:** Molly Santana is crazy.  
3. **Kai Cenat:** MrBeastâ€™s Credit Card to the hood.  
4. **Mrwhosetheboss:** iPhone 16 review.  
5. **KTO:** Molly Santana Interview.  
6. **Complex:** PinkPantheress *On My Phone*.  
7. **Agent00:** Reacting to Miami BBLs and the dark side of BBLs.

**Random Realization:**  
I know it's just the algorithm doing its thing, but isn't it strange how I've *never* been recommended a video Iâ€™ve already watched? Iâ€™ll have to dig deeper into thisâ€”could be a quirk of how those models handle user preferences.

---

**Reminder:**  

- Download an app to read that psychology ePub smoothly (Revel). **Update:** Itâ€™s paid. Forget it.  
- Clean up the PC files (*zerotrace*, thatâ€™s future meâ€™s headache).  

---

**Learning: (Today was Python-heavy)**  

- **Dunders** (double underscore methods)  
- **Mindmaps** (okay, not Python, but still...)  
- Revisited **f-strings**  
- **Methods vs. Functions**  
- Reminded myself about **language levels**  
- **Comments** (always need to be on top of this)  
- **Memory architectures**  
- **Params**  
- **Dictionaries**

**Thought:**  
Association is a funny thing. Today in the office, this cool breeze hit me, and out of nowhere, I remembered a song title. Weird how a simple gust can trigger a whole mental playlist. Iâ€™m curious to explore this moreâ€”might dig into how sensory stimuli influence memory.

---

**Reminder:**  

- [ ] Create a routine for this yearâ€™s internship and actually try to stick to it.  
- Fill in the damn intern logbook (don't procrastinate again).

**New Music:**  

- **[[ |Molly Santana - Masonic Musik (EP)]]**: 6/10â€”I'll need to review this later, but for now, it felt kind of average.  
- **Che (or Cheromani, depending who you ask) - Sayso Says (Album)**: 8/10â€”His girl calls him Chase, lol. Pretty solid; I'll give it a more detailed review later.  
- **babyxsosa - Everywhereigo (single)**: 9/10â€”The drowned vocals were cool at first, but the repetition of the beat and flow knocked off a point.  
- **Rico Nasty - Las Ruinas (Album)**: [DF]â€”Wild and unique, but I havenâ€™t finished it yet.  
- **Bktherula - Love Black (Album)**: [DF]â€”So far, itâ€™s blowing me away.
