**September 23, 2024 - Monday Musings**

**Work Stuff (Attachment Realities)**

So today was the day I finally took this attachment job seriously—like, actually serious. I had 10 machines left to service, and I’d promised Maina that everything would be done by Monday. Spoiler: Monday is today. Got to work early, blew out the rest of the machines, and wrapped it all up.

There was this moment that hit kinda hard, though. I was about to finish and went to Maina's place hoping to get quotations for town. But Maina hit me with the "Did you finish servicing the machines?"—and yeah, my answer was a solid "No." He told me to handle that first, and it just clicked: Why did it take me two whole weeks to handle 23 machines? Two weeks. For real. 

Note to self: Call Erick to confirm Dennis’ attachment status. Don't forget this.

Even though I met the deadline, I can't help but feel like I kinda lied to myself. Like, if I hadn’t been slacking, I’d have knocked out the servicing, and maybe I’d have made it to town today for those quotations. I really felt that. 

**Lesson Time:**
1. Do the work you set out to do—like, seriously, just get it done. 
2. Stop stressing about things beyond your control; what's done is done. Focus on now.

**Wondering on a Monday Morning**

Today started out suspiciously perfect. No traffic, no station drama; everything moved like clockwork. That never happens. Then the intern girl from the other day popped up. Saw her, greeted her—she hey’d back (is that even grammar?). 

And out of nowhere, I got this weird feeling. Like, why am I overthinking a simple "hey"? Was it awkward? Should it have gone differently? I never feel this weird over a greeting. It was just... odd.

**To Be Continued...**

Hope this keeps your vibe and captures the day as you felt it!
