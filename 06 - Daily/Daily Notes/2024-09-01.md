# DAILY NOTE
### *Sunday, September 1st, 2024*

## Journal
Earphones are back in business! Now I can finally get back to my “GOOSEBUMP INDUCING SHIT” playlist. It’s amazing how much you miss music when it’s gone – like a best friend who doesn’t talk back but always gets the vibe right. Today’s soundtrack is courtesy of Destroy Lonely, aka Baby Money (he’s on some artist-name-as-a-mood thing, I guess). His new album feels like a late-night drive through a city where you’re not sure if you’re looking for trouble or just trying to clear your head.

But I gotta admit, I also found myself looping back to JID's Album "The Forever Story" and the song "Crack Sandwich" That one’s a whole different beast – more like a tight lyrical rope swing between gritty storytelling and an almost jazz-like flow. It’s like he’s having a conversation with his own thoughts and family while I’m just hanging on for the ride. Makes you wonder: can a song be therapy? If so, JID is on some serious healing business.

On a mission to expand my musical horizons, I’m thinking tomorrow’s playlist needs a dose of rock. I’ve always wondered if I’m missing out on some secret energy boost, like maybe Led Zeppelin’s "Immigrant Song" could be my new morning alarm. Fingers crossed it doesn’t scare the neighbors.

Picked up some cool words today too:

- **Incel** – learned the backstory, and, well, let's just say it's a word with a lot of layers. Not one you drop lightly.
- **Reprimand** – basically a formal way of getting told off. Could be useful next time I get into a debate about, I don’t know, anything.
- **Esoteric** – a great word for when you’re feeling a bit like a gatekeeper of hidden knowledge.
- **Tongue-in-cheek** – sarcasm's more refined cousin. This one I’m definitely adding to my arsenal.
## Ongoing Tasks
- [x] Finished up my note on **Thales** – tried to keep it interesting, like the guy was inventing philosophy _and_ Instagram captions. ✅ 2024-09-01
- [x] Wrote a fresh **Sophistic Story** with a modern twist – think less Socrates, more social media drama. ✅ 2024-09-01
- [x] Played around with some CSS for **centering images in Obsidian** – because, let's face it, notes should look good too. ✅ 2024-09-01
- [x] Got lost in the idea of **metaphysical waffles**. Who knew breakfast could get so deep? Spoiler: they’re both crunchy _and_ soft. ✅ 2024-09-01
