# DAILY NOTE
### *Monday, September 2nd, 2024*

## Journal

Started at 8 AM, the usual stuff—tea, dishes, prepping for the day. Right when I was about to fire up the laptop, BAM! The power goes out. Classic. But hey, it comes back after a while, and I get sidetracked scrolling through reels. Normally, Instagram ads are white noise to me, but today, one of them actually caught my eye. It was for this platform called "Short Reel," promoting a short film called *Something’s Call Boy* (not sure if that’s the name, but close enough). I got curious, so I downloaded the app super fast, like record speed. 

Watched a few episodes—no ads popping up, just pure content. My first thought: "How are they making money?" Then I realized they use this coin system—you either watch ads to earn coins and unlock more episodes, or you just go premium. I respect that move. At least they’re not shoving ads down your throat while you’re watching. Smart branding, if you ask me.

Then, guess what? Power’s out again. Feels like the universe is sending me a wake-up call: "Get your act together, Dylan." When the lights flick back on, I snap out of it and put the phone away. I’ve got an interview today for an internship. Check my schedule and realize it’s go-time. Head over to pick up my trousers from the tailor… but the shop is closed. *I’m cooked.*

So, I go back home and dig out an older pair, pick my best shirt, and fire up the iron. And guess what? The power goes out again. No time to waste, so I roll with the wrinkled look and get ready as best as I can. No turning back now.

On the way to the interview, I hop into this matatu, and the conductor is bursting with energy, like he’s been sipping jet fuel. It was contagious. Then this guy rolls in with a bike… IN the matatu. My mind starts racing with ideas—imagine if you could disassemble a bike and keep it in your car, ready for any adventure, anywhere. No more long walks in remote areas when you’re in exploration mode. The possibilities are endless!

The interview goes way smoother than the last one. Confidence was high, and it paid off—I start on Wednesday! Called my dad to give him the good news, then jumped back into another matatu to head home. Two girls hop in, chatting loudly about some dude with 700 euros in his bank account. I’m like, "First, who announces their bank balance in public like that? And second, 700 euros… not that impressive." That’s like 99,754.91 KES, to be exact (yeah, I looked it up).

They start talking about "M-Pesa kids" from GEMS Cambridge International. I get bored, so my mind starts doing its usual thing—gathering info like I’m Sherlock Holmes. Turns out, one lives here in Rongai, the other doesn’t; one’s at Multimedia Uni, and they’re both big on concerts and the party life. My internal monologue bets they’ll get off at Masai Lodge, and guess what? They do. Did I get it right, or was it just hindsight bias? I’ll never know, but it was fun to play detective for a bit.

Finally, I get home, and the power’s still out. I kill some time watching an already downloaded YouTube video on the largest leak in history, the Vault 7 files from WikiLeaks. The dude who leaked it, Shawlt, was a character—fired his good lawyer to represent himself after studying law. Crazy, but kinda badass.

Took a power nap from 2 to 3 PM, then my little brother got home from school. We took a walk to the field, got back, and I helped him with his homework. Finally—FINALLY—the power comes back. My brother tries turning on the home theater like he usually does, but this time, the power source wasn’t switched on. I nudged him with hints like, “Yes, but it’s not turned on,” and “Where do you usually turn it off when you sleep?” He figured it out on his own and was super proud. Then I helped him get cleaned up, and here I am, wrapping up this day with this note.
