I'm trying to go through therapy without going to an actual Physical therapist and main reason is because I don't have the money yet to afford a physical one. But once I have money I will get one. Also, at my School there is a therapist, so I might go there once schools open but for now I'm watching YouTube videos on topics I feel the need for therapy, elements that I need to focus on are my weak points eg(confidence, patience, focus)

#### How to Stop Taking Things Personally

MY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Learn to accept constructive criticism** - People that genuinely care for us want what's best for us (for the most part) always make constructive criticisms. So accepting what they tell us is the best and most mature thing to do. Instead of taking things personally, accepting and recognizing that we are on the wrong mostly will ensure that we improve as human beings.

2. **Taking things personally is a defensive mechanism that the brain automatically does to survive** - When people offer Constructive criticism we naturally take offence for our survival because the brain protects us from threats and takes the Criticism as an attack. naturally the brain has three modes : (FFF) fight, flight, freeze this is to help us survive, and so to counter this we should accept Criticism to show the brain that its not an attack and that its fine this person is on our side

3. **We need to slow the response time** - the brains FFF system is fast in response and we need to slow this action down to think of the other person's intentions first before response.

4. **Use the three steps** :
	1. **clarity** 
		1. Short term : **use words like**
					*- "say that again??"*
					*-  "I'll think about that??"*
					*- "interesting..."*
					*- "thanks for you opinion on that"*
		2. Medium term : Think whether to take action on it (as in work on it, discuss it more etc) or discard the matter
		3. Long term : Repeat short term and medium term

	2. **boundaries** - learn what you can and can't control.
	3. **solid foundation if self-worth** -
