**Date**: 16-09-24

### **Dream Overview**:
- I was with Sylvester (high school friend) and Dennis (college friend). We were dealing with a broken bed, argued, but eventually fixed it. We booked a bus to head somewhere, and I found people sitting in my seat.
- A girl, who I didn’t recognize, called my name. She knew me from school (college) and recognized me even though I didn’t know her. We got out of the bus to chat, and she asked what I’ve been into lately. I told her philosophy, and she said, “cool.”
- The dream shifted to me rushing to pack for work as an intern, feeling unprepared, and trying to change into proper work clothes just before my alarm woke me up at 5 a.m.

**Key Themes**:
- **Confidence in unfamiliar situations**: Even though I didn’t know the girl, I felt confident talking to her, and throughout the dream, I had a sense of self-assurance.
- **Merging of past and present**: High school and college friends appeared together, symbolizing different stages of life influencing where I am now.
- **Fixing the bed**: Possibly symbolizes resolving conflicts or unstable situations in my life.
- **Feeling unprepared for work**: Reflects a sense of anxiety or pressure about responsibilities, but confidence in handling it.

**Insights**:
- This dream reflects my current state of becoming more self-assured, even in situations where I might feel uncertain. The unknown girl recognizing me could symbolize my growing confidence in being recognized for who I am becoming.
- The transition from personal reflection (philosophy chat with the girl) to rushing for work could indicate a balancing act between my inner passions and external obligations.

### **Random Thought Note: Confidence and Uncertainty**

**Thoughts**:
- I’ve recently become more **self-assured** and self-aware, but I’m striving to carry that confidence into areas where I feel unsure or don’t know how to react.
- I realized that **confidence doesn’t always mean having all the answers**. It’s about being comfortable in the unknown, and being open to navigating through discomfort.
- I can use my interest in philosophy to approach uncertain situations—asking questions, observing, and engaging thoughtfully rather than feeling like I need to have the perfect response.
- This self-assurance might also be tied to my growing understanding of who I am, reflected in the dream, where even strangers recognize a part of me that’s becoming more defined.
