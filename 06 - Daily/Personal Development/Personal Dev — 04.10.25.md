idk man. i just feel like this is the year i stop waiting for shit to happen.  
i’ve been patient long enough. too patient sometimes.  
not in a bitter way, just tired of sitting in park while the world spins.

this year’s for showing up. not loud, not performative. just consistent.  
doing what i said i’d do even when nobody’s watching.  
i’m not chasing that perfection bs anymore, i just want actual progress.

people come and go. i still care, but i’m not begging for energy back.  
i’ll keep being the person who shows up, but i won’t let it drain me.  
whatever doesn’t match my frequency can fade quietly.

money’s still in the picture. i won’t lie — i want it.  
not to flex, but to buy my freedom. to buy shit i want without thinking twice.  
to stop waiting for someone else to do something nice for me.  
it’s not about worth, it’s about control.

this year i’m feeding my brain until it hurts. learning until i lose track of time.  
i don’t even want applause. i just want to look back and see proof that i wasn’t bluffing.  
no potential talk. just results.

if i read this next year, i hope i can say  
“yeah… i actually became him.”
