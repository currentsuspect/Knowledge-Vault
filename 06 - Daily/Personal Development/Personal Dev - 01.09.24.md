### **Dylan’s Everything Vault — Grand Plan**

**Location:** Rongai, Regular Sitting  
**Time:** 12:12 PM

### **The Decision to Reset: Why Start Over?**

1. **Wiping the Slate Clean:** I decided to clear out my old Obsidian vault and start fresh. This wasn’t just a whim — I needed a clearer structure that reflects where I’m heading, not just where I’ve been.

2. **Issues with the Old Vault:**  
   - It was cluttered and disorganized, making it hard to find anything useful. It wasn't built for the long haul, and I want this new setup to support my long-term growth.
   - My thoughts were too shallow. I know that hindsight always makes me feel this way, but this time, I’m pushing for real evolution.

3. **Shift in Thinking:**  
   - I feel like my mind is changing — I’m less attached to old ideas and more open to new ones. I want to keep pushing that openness, even when it challenges what I think I know.

### **The Plan Moving Forward**

1. **Stay Consistent:** Make updating this vault a habit. Whenever an idea hits, jot it down. No more letting insights slip away. 

2. **Be Honest and Real:** I’m committing to radical honesty. No more censoring myself with thoughts like, “That sounds dumb,” or “I’m being extra.” Every bit of growth comes from being true to myself.

3. **Integrate with the Vault:** I want this vault to be more than a tool — I want it to reflect my thinking so closely that it’s almost a part of me.

4. **Learn with Purpose:** Focus on learning efficiently and effectively. I don’t want to just memorize facts; I want to deeply understand concepts and explain them in my own words.

5. **Stay Humble:** Keep my ego in check. Feeling “better than others” just because I’m learning new stuff is a trap. It limits my growth and makes me resistant to new perspectives.

### **Defining Full Growth**

1. **Intellectual Understanding:**  
   - Improve cognitive skills like reasoning, analyzing, and synthesizing. Learn to see connections between different ideas and apply this knowledge creatively.  
   - Be open to new ideas and perspectives, even when they challenge my current beliefs.

2. **Emotional Maturity:**  
   - Develop a deeper understanding and management of my own emotions, and be better at recognizing and responding to the emotions of others.

**Areas for Growth:**  
- Critical Thinking  
- Effective Communication  
- Problem-Solving  
- Independence  
- Adaptability  
- Self-Awareness

### **Learning Preferences and Focus Areas**

1. **Preferred Learning Style:**  
   - 1. Discussions  
   - 2. Hands-on Experiments  
   - 3. Videos  

2. **Top Priorities:**  
   - 1. Philosophy  
   - 2. Programming  
   - 3. Psychology  
   - 4. Music  

3. **Applying What I Learn:**  
   - **Express my views actively** — this sharpens my understanding of philosophy, psychology, and language.  
   - **Create projects with deadlines**, no external references, to test if I’ve truly grasped concepts.  
   - Specific projects: productivity programs to learn faster, and philosophical debates with friends to challenge my thinking.
   - **Creating Hypothetical Scenarios:**
   - Imagine different situations — real or fantastical — where I’d need to use the skills or knowledge I’m working on. For example, constructing a dialogue between two opposing philosophical views to test my understanding, or developing a scenario where a coding problem requires multiple solutions and methods.
   - By mentally navigating these “what if” situations, I can explore concepts from new angles and reinforce my understanding in a dynamic way. It's like a sandbox for my brain — a place to safely test, break down, and rebuild ideas without real-world consequences.

### **How I’ll Use This Vault**

1. **Frequent Updates:**  
   - Add new entries whenever inspiration strikes. No strict schedule, but stay consistent.

2. **Entry Focus:**  
   - Random thoughts, summaries, reflections.

3. **Note-Taking Strategy:**  
   - A blend of Zettelkasten and PARA methods to keep my thoughts organized but flexible.

### **Long-Term Vision:**

This vault isn’t just a place to store ideas. It’s a dynamic tool to track my growth, sharpen my thinking, and help me become who I want to be. It’s my roadmap, constantly evolving with me.
