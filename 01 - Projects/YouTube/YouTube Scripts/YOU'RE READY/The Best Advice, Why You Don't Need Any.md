“I’ve come to the conclusion that the best advice in life is… no advice at all. Now, before you jump to the comments hold on — let me explain.

### **The Illusion of Certainty**

Why do we crave advice? Because we crave certainty. We want to know we’re making the 'right' decision, that we’re on the 'correct' path. But here’s the catch: life doesn’t come with a road map. There’s no instruction manual. And honestly? That’s a good thing.

If there were a foolproof way to live, wouldn’t we all be doing the same thing? Yet, here we are, winging it, pretending we know what we’re doing. Advice can often give us a false sense of certainty, like following someone else’s ‘proven’ path will protect us from failure. But let’s be real—that’s just an illusion.

The only real certainty in life is uncertainty itself. The sooner we accept that, the sooner we can start embracing the unknown and trusting ourselves to navigate it. The ‘right’ decision isn’t always the one that checks all the boxes; it’s the one that feels true to you, even if it makes no sense to anyone else.

Consider this: many of the people we admire—whether in business, art, or just living authentically—they got where they are by being a little… delusional. They didn’t always make the logical choice. They didn’t play it safe. They followed what felt right to them, even when it made no sense to anyone else. They took risks, embraced the unknown, and maybe they were a bit ‘delulu,’ but that’s exactly what set them apart.

### **Just Experience It**

“So yeah, I’ve spent a lot of time searching for guidance, asking for directions, trying to figure out my next move. And sure, I’ve heard some good advice… and plenty that was, let’s say, less than helpful.

What really hit me is that no matter what advice I got, I was always the one who had to decide what to do with it. And that’s where it gets interesting.

You see, we understand others to the extent that we understand ourselves. Advice might seem like it makes sense, but we’re really only listening if it resonates with something inside us. Most advice is just a motivator—a nudge toward a direction we were already considering because it aligns with our own experiences and intuition.

So yeah, advice can light a fire under us when we’re unsure or give us the courage to act. But the real answers? They don’t come from someone else’s words. They come from within—from what feels right to us based on where we are in life at that moment.”

### **Do More, Listen Less!**

“So what now? Should I trust my gut and go buy those new Balenciaga shoes that cost more than my car? Maybe... (chuckles). Or, better yet, should I quit my job, sell everything, and start a business selling artisanal lemonade in the middle of winter? (laughs) Yeah, no. If that’s your takeaway, you’ve missed the point entirely.

My point is this: life is about experience, about living it, making mistakes, learning, and doing better next time. It’s not about blindly following what someone else says—whether that’s buying shoes you can’t afford or jumping into a risky business venture because someone told you it was a ‘sure thing.’ You have to live with the consequences of your choices, so make sure they’re truly yours.

That’s not to say you shouldn’t listen to anyone—of course, listen. But remember, the decision is ultimately yours. Don’t just run with advice because it sounds good. Weigh it against what you know, feel, and believe to be true. Then make your move.”

### **Trust Your Intuition… Sometimes**

“And speaking of trusting yourself, let’s talk about intuition. Ever had a gut feeling about something, but ignored it because someone gave you advice that contradicted it? And then later, when things went sideways, you thought, ‘I knew I should have trusted my gut’?

That’s because intuition is our inner compass, guiding us toward what feels right and away from what doesn’t. And while it’s not always easy to trust, especially when it goes against conventional wisdom, it’s almost always worth listening to.

I’m not saying you should ignore all advice and just follow your gut. But your intuition is a valuable tool, often overlooked in favor of more ‘rational’ advice. So next time you face a decision, check in with yourself. What does your gut say? What feels right, even if you can’t explain why? That’s your intuition talking. And it might just be the best advice you’ll ever get.”

### **The Danger of Overthinking**

“Now, let’s talk about overthinking. Because when it comes to taking advice, overthinking can be your worst enemy. It’s easy to fall into the trap of analyzing every possible outcome, every potential consequence, until you’re so paralyzed by indecision that you end up doing nothing at all. While it’s important to think through your decisions, there comes a point where overthinking just becomes an excuse for inaction.

How do you know when you’ve crossed that line? When you’re going in circles, second-guessing every instinct and piece of advice, that’s a sign it’s time to stop thinking and start doing. Because at the end of the day, the only way to know if a decision is right for you is to make it and see what happens. And while that can be scary, it’s incredibly liberating. You’re no longer beholden to anyone else’s opinion—you’re free to make your own choices, to live your life on your terms.”

### **The Importance of Failure**

“Here’s another thing to consider: failure is not the enemy. In fact, it’s often our greatest teacher. When we fail, we learn. We figure out what works and what doesn’t. And while it’s natural to want to avoid failure, doing so can actually hold us back.

So next time you’re tempted to take advice just to avoid failure, remember this: failure is not the opposite of success; it’s part of it. It’s the stepping stone to where we want to go. And while it might be uncomfortable, even painful, it’s valuable. Through failure, we discover our strengths, our passions, and ourselves. And that’s advice no one else can give you.”

### **Conclusion:**

“So, after all that, I’ve been procrastinating on this video for like 2-3 weeks. It’s been sitting in the back of my mind, festering with doubt. I was worried about what people would say, so much so that I almost didn’t do it. But here I am, talking to you, putting it out there, because sometimes you just have to trust your gut and go for it.

Sure, there’s a chance people will disagree or that it won’t resonate with everyone. But that’s okay. This is my voice, my perspective, and if it reaches even one person who needed to hear it, then it was worth it.

So, if you’re sitting on something, waiting for the ‘perfect moment’ or the ‘right advice,’ let me be the one to tell you: just go for it. Trust yourself, take the leap, and remember—the only person who truly knows what’s right for you is you.
